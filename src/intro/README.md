# Introduction

## What is this?

This is an introduction to robotics that assumes you know some basics of
computer programming and mathematics. These tutorials bridge the gap between toy
kits and advanced topics in a way that is accessible: you do not have to enroll
in an elite university to learn on real robots that are relevant to practice.

We take an exercise-oriented approach. Part of the fun of robotics is
"learning by doing", and we achieve that by remote sandboxes hosted by
[rerobots](https://rerobots.net/).

## Do I have to pay for this?

No. The book is free and [open source](https://github.com/rerobots/sessions),
but we happily accept payment through [our Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/robotsessions)
to support ongoing work.

Exercises in this book are performed on robots that you can access anonymously
and freely, but with some constraints like time limits and input filtering. If
you want more time and lower-level access to the robots, create a paid user
account on [rerobots.net](https://rerobots.net/).

## How is this book organized?
