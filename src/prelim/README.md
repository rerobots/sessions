# Not robotics per se

This book does not assume any prior experience or knowledge in robotics.
However, there are topics that must be known before you can progress, especially
with respect to mathematics.

Because of the extensive overlap with other disciplines, there is often no clear
boundary between a "preliminary" topic and a "robotics" topic.
