Summary
-------

We only had 1 person join the session. Instead of slides and a guided
presentation, all three of us talked about our prior work and current goals. We
also discussed technical debt when building robots, in particular ROS version 1
vs. ROS 2. The UR5 was shown briefly via rerobots. Motion commands were sent
using the Python package `ur_rtde`.

The UR5 interface was not presented in detail. We will do that at the next session!
